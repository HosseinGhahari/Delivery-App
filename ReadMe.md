<h1>ِAsp.net Core Razor Pages - Delivery App 🚲</h1>

<p>🌀 Quiclk Story : While learning programming, I’m also working as a bicycle delivery person.<br>
I’ve created a handy app to manage my operations and finances. 
It’s a fun blend of work <br> learning, and practical application!</p>

<p>✅ "I've developed a delivery app using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages with ASP.NET Core Identity <br> for authentication and Onion Architecture for clean, maintainable code. This approach <br> has significantly improved both code organization and readability. As I continue to gain experience,<br> I'm consistently refining and enhancing the application."
