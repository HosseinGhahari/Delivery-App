<h1>ِAsp.net Core Razor Pages - Delivery App 🚲</h1>

<p>🌀 Quiclk Story : While learning programming, I’m also working as a bicycle delivery person.<br>
I’ve created a handy app to manage my operations and finances. 
It’s a fun blend of work <br> learning, and practical application!</p>

<p>✅ I’ve created a delivery app using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, employing Onion <br> Architecture for clean code. This has enhanced the code’s maintainability and readability <br> and I’m continually refining it as I gain more experience.</p>
